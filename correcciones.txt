Hi Yannis! I have been reading your comments, thanks a lot for the time you took reading the TFG! I have already fixed the most straigthforward ones, however there are others I am not too sure about. 

First of all there are many comments where I don't really understand your handwriting hahahahahah. To be precise, the comments in pages 4, 23 (second comment), 25, 29, 32, 35, 36 and 45 are the ones I don't understand. 

Also, I assume all the underlining and circling of sentences is to highlight important parts for yourself, there is nothing to change there right?

Regarding the comment on page 23 about the CAGR, yes it is quite different. For example, a 140% return over 15 years is a 6% CAGR but a 9.3% mean return.

And regarding the comments in p.12, what is the appropriate reference for the trigger?

Finally, regarding the building of the factors and the TFG, I built the factors after finishing the TFG and for the analysis I used the downloaded factors, that is why I didn't explain the building in the TFG. I built them just because I thought it could be useful for you for the paper, but for the TFG I don't know if it makes sense to redo it again with the homemade factors.  

If you want to talk about any of these things we can hop on a call whenever you want.
